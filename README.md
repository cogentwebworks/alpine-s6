## What is ALPINE LINUX ?
>Alpine Linux is an independent, non-commercial, general purpose Linux distribution designed for power users who appreciate security, simplicity and resource efficiency.

>Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. A container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk requires around 130 MB of storage. Not only do you get a fully-fledged Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository.

## What is S6-OVERLAY ?
>The s6-overlay-builder project is a series of init scripts and utilities to ease creating Docker images using s6 as a process supervisor.
